First of,Thank you for purchasing my product!



About The Spells :

	The spells are made mostly from particles, the arrows are made of two 3D planes so that collisions may be added.

Easy SetUp:

	Add the JavaScript ArrowShot to your character , by default the PoisonArrowShotParticle is attached , you can change it at will,
	 select your character attack animation
	 	open up Animation window by pressing CTRL+6
	 		scroll thru the animation in to a point where the SpellShot should ocure , right Clik and add an Animation event and select END() as function

	 		Now when your character plays its animation the spell will ocure, the arrow will be summoned and if its not destroyed by collision it wil be destroyed affter 4 seconds.

	 	See the Cubes Example i provided !

		All the best to you!
